JabbR.Eto
=========
### A cross platform JabbR client for OS X, Windows, and Linux

Description
-----------

This project aims to create a great cross platform desktop client for [JabbR](http://jabbr.net).
This makes liberal use of the following libraries:

* [Eto.Forms](https://github.com/picoe/Eto) - Cross Platform UI toolkit
* [JabbR.Client](https://github.com/davidfowl/JabbR.Client) - .NET API for creating JabbR clients 
* [SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR) - Async library for .NET to help build real-time, multi-user interactive web applications
* [Json.NET](http://json.codeplex.com/) - Json.NET is a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET

Status
------

JabbR.Eto is in a very early state and is missing many features.

Currently you can log in (via username/password), view and /join channels, and chat in
